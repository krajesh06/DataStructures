# 0/1 Knapsack Problem

- What is it?
- What is 0/1 mean?
- Can we solve it DP?
- What DP approach you would use to solve the 0/1 knapsack
- What would be our base or intial condition
- What is the formula you use to fill the table

- What is subsequence?
- What is a common subsequence in a string?
- What is meant by longest common subsequence?
- Can we solve it DP?
- What DP approach you would use to solve the LCS
- What would be our base or intial condition
- What is the formula you use to fill the table
