## Collecting Numbers II
You are given an array that contains each number between 1…n1…n exactly once. Your task is to collect the numbers from 1 to nn in increasing order.

On each round, you go through the array from left to right and collect as many numbers as possible.

Given m operations that swap two numbers in the array, your task is to report the number of rounds after each operation.

### Input

The first line has two integers nn and mm: the array size and the number of operations.

The next line has nn integers x1,x2,…,xnx1,x2,…,xn: the numbers in the array.

Finally, there are mm lines that describe the operations. Each line has two integers aa and bb: the numbers at positions aa and bb are swapped.

### Output

Print mm integers: the number of rounds after each swap.

### Constraints

•	1≤n,m≤2⋅1051≤n,m≤2⋅105
•	1≤a,b≤n1≤a,b≤n
