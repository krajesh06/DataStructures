# Greedy Algorithms

- Approach for solving a problem, piece by piece, always choosing the best option available at the time
- Doesn’t worry whether the current best will bring the overall optimal result
- There is no going back once we decided!
  - Even it would be wrong!
- Let’s learn 3 greedy algorithms.
  - Prims Algorithm
  - Kruskal's Algorithm
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm

# Kruskal's Algorithm

- Used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph
- Click [here](./Krushal) to see the implementation code
- Click [here](./Krushal/KruAdjanceyMatrixIn2dArrays.java) to see the code when you're input is adjancey Matrix

# Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Used to find the single source shortest path between source to any other vertices of a graph.
- Click [here](/DijkstrasDemo.java) to see the implementation code
