## Linked List: Sum of 3 highest elements

A linked list containing N elements is given.

Print the sum of the highest three elements of the linked list.

### Note - The linked list contains more than three elements.

## Input Format

The first line contains N denoting the size of the linked list.
The second line contains the entries of the linked list.

## Sample Input
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

## Constraints
4 < = N <= 109
-109 <=  Ai <= 109

## Output Format
The output contains an integer element representing the sum of the highest 3 elements of a given linked list.

## Sample Output
```
15
```

## Explanation
```
N = 6
Linked list => 1->2->3->4->5->6
As evident by the given linked list while traversing, the largest three elements present will be 6, 5, 4.
Hence, output will be = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.
