## Trees

- Non-Linear Data structure
- In hierarchical manner
- consists of nodes connected by edges.
- Tree Example
- Logical Respresentation of Tree

## Binary Tree 
- Binary Tree can have 2 children for each element - Right Child and Left Child 
- Types
  - Full Binary Tree
  - Perfect Binary Tree
  - Complete Binary Tree
  - Degenerate or Pathological Tree
  - Balanced Binary Tree
  - Skewed Binary Tree

## Binary Search Tree

- Binary Search Tree can have 2 children for each element.
    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.

  - Pre Order, Post Order and In Order Traversal
  - Height or Depth of the Tree

## AVL Tree (and its Rotations)

- AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which each node maintains extra information called a balance factor whose value is either -1, 0 or +1.
- AVL tree got its name after its inventor Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Landis.
- **Balance Factor = (Height of Left Subtree - Height of Right Subtree) or (Height of Right Subtree - Height of Left Subtree)**
- Whenever we do insertion or deletion in a AVL, we have to check the balance factor for all the node
- When the balance factor is other than -1, 0, -1.. then the tree is unbalance
- To make unbalanced to balance, we can perform 4 rotations
  - LL rotation
  - RR rotation
  - LR rotation
  - RL rotation

## Search a Node in BST

### Problem Statement
*Given a BST, write an efficient function to search a given key in it. The algorithm should return the parent node of the key and print if the key is the left or right node of the parent node. If the key is not present in the BST, the algorithm should be able to determine that.*

### Solution
```java
public static void search(Node root, int key, Node parent) {
		if(root == null) {
			System.out.println("key Not Found");
			return;
		}else {
			if (key < root.data) {
				search(root.left, key, root);
			}
			else if(key > root.data){
				search(root.right, key, root);
			}else {
				if(parent == null) {
					System.out.println("key is the root node");
				} else if (key < parent.data) {
					System.out.println("key is in the left of " + parent.data);
				} else {
					System.out.println("key is in the right of " + parent.data);
				}
			}
		}
	}
